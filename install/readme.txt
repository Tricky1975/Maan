Make sure that before you start working on anything that you have a few things in order.

The script without extension is for mac. The one with the .bat extension is for Windows

I should note that in order to set anything up for either platform you need the OS yourself. This has to do with the way the compiler has been set up.
For now all sources have only been set up for the "Vanilla" version of BlitzMax, these scripts however should work on "NG" as well, but the original source codes may not.


In Mac you should first do the following
- Make sure you have the Vanilla version of BlitzMax installed
- Make sure you have the JCR6 CLI tools intalled
- Make sure you have the "zipstream" module (Kiriolis) and Volumes module (Brucey) installed
- Make sure you have the modules in the https://github.com/Tricky1975/TrickyMod installed
- Make sure everything is compiled prior to doing anything
- When you are in this install folder type first "nano makemaan" and edit the variable definitions to make sure utilities are properly called

On Windows you should first do the following
- Make sure you have the Vanilla version of BlitzMax installed
- Make sure you have the JCR6 CLI tools intalled
- Make sure you have the "zipstream" module (Kiriolis) and Volumes module (Brucey) installed
- Make sure you have the modules in the https://github.com/Tricky1975/TrickyMod installed
- Make sure everything is compiled prior to doing anything
- Open makemaan.bat in wordpad and edit the variable definitions to make sure the utilities are properly called

Now running "makemaan" / "makemaan.bat" should run from the terminal.
